# Human
Human is hypocritic, destructive and selfish if you think subjectively.


| What you think              | How you act           |
| ---- | ---- |
| Moral Values are important  | Sacrifice them in front of money|
| Starving ppl in Africa needs help | Spend all money for just yourself |
| Environment Destruction is bad | Destroy them for Enjoyments & Entertainments |
| Animal should not be harmed | Eat more Food than that you need|
| Modifying Embryo is not OK  | OK to jerk off (killing them) |
